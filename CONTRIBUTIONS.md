_By [@nash](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9LQD9TMK)_

_By [@rozanne](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9WNZ7C74) and [@angus](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UC6JH787K)_  
Rozanne de Jager and I created this application during the Build an AR app on Root Insurance course, at Make by OfferZen. It was a great day, and doing work with Augmented Reality is so tangible and cool. You can take a look at the video of the project [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kNBLJUVC2TgRWWfY7).

### [Text Editor](https://bitbucket.org/waydemlyle/makeday/src/master/)

### [Card Protection Game](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/files/UCB4MAGAF/FCCB71543/archive.zip)
_By [@Denzil Buchner](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCB4MAGAF) and [@rohan.buchner](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9QECBU1Z)_  
The idea is to allow each player to scan 3 cards, and insure it against "fire" or "lightning" - basically setting up each card as an insurance policy against each thread. Its up to the player to remember what he assigned to each card. After both players assigned their cards, as instructed by the game, it will randomly chooses the next "threat" and the player has to play their policy to protect against the threat. If they dont have the right policy (or played the wrong one), they lose. WIP. You can download the project.

Choose your player between a male, female or smoker. After that, play on a busy road with your character, trying to avoid the traffic. Take a look at the video [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNmSWFsGrhR7HUkSrBaxBcCi5ubInOLbxdvE4snYSV8j9DhmbjGFWDOwOUFPiFnDg/photo/AF1QipMDE6HF_8gpQnrsCu9u9yEQHK_F-SG55o5ggPfc?key=cHFNTHRtVUNZUzZzaWRBR0dPbVRNUER5ajlrNXZR).

_By [@Regan](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCDTWU2T0) and [@Dewald Ayres](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCBCNEVEW)_  
This project detects two image targets and renders 3D cars in an AR scene. When they collide and crash into each other, smoke pours out of the car hoods. Then a Root API request could be made, to process an insurance claim. You can take a look at the video [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNmSWFsGrhR7HUkSrBaxBcCi5ubInOLbxdvE4snYSV8j9DhmbjGFWDOwOUFPiFnDg/photo/AF1QipPfmDN-wYKHhR06EOmq_iIgXli_Xgt5IlOHHyq8?key=cHFNTHRtVUNZUzZzaWRBR0dPbVRNUER5ajlrNXZR).
