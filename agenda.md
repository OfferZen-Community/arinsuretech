# About Make Days

## Purpose of the day

We're going to be learning how to build AR apps and integrate them with the Root Insurance API. It's a fact that people learn best when doing things together, so you'll be working with a small team on the day.

At the end of the day everybody discusses what and how they learned. You should be able to answer these two questions in that discussion:

1.  What did you and your team mate/s do and what did you learn?
2.  How did the Make Day contribute towards your learning, and what can we improve?
